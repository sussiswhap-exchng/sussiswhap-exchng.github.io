<h1>Sushiswap trade volume and market listings</h1>
<p>As of September 2019, Sushiswap had a 24-hour trade volume of $1.4 million and was ranked 84th on CoinMarketCap. It was also listed on a number of exchanges, including Binance, OKEx, and Huobi Global.
Sushiswap is a decentralized exchange built on the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens. The platform uses the Automated Market Maker (AMM) model, which enables it to provide liquidity to its users.
Sushiswap was launched in September 2019 by an anonymous team of developers. The platform quickly gained popularity due to its low fees and easy-to-use interface.
In November 2019, Sushiswap launched its own token, SUSHI, which can be used to pay fees on the platform or to earn rewards for providing liquidity.
Since its launch, Sushiswap has become one of the most popular decentralized exchanges in the Ethereum ecosystem.</p>
<h1>What Does the Future Hold for Sushiswap?</h1>
<p>The sushi-themed decentralized exchange, Sushiswap, has had a roller coaster of a year. After a successful launch in September 2020, the project shot to the top of the DeFi space, with a peak TVL of over $13 billion. However, shortly after, the project was beset by a number of high-profile hacks and exploits, which led to a mass exodus of users and a drastic reduction in TVL. In the months since, the team has worked hard to rebuild trust and confidence in the project, and has made a number of changes and improvements to the protocol. With the DeFi space still red-hot and Sushiswap's TVL once again on the rise, it's safe to say that the future looks bright for the sushi-themed DEX.</p>
